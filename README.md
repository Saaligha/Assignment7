# Narrative:
The problem domain I have chosen is the language barrier between people when travelling or even moving to a different country. Language barriers prevent people from interacting efficiently, due to this people are uncomfortable in their surroundings and were they to perhaps find themselves in a difficult or threatening situation them having a language barrier would be detrimental to themselves or their lives. I intend to solve this problem by creating a platform for people to learn new languages quickly with tailored quizzes and information concerning their chosen language. The application will provide a user to choose a specific language to learn, they will have the option to learn simple phrases such as greetings, numbers, directions and simple conversations. They will also have the option to go further in depth into the language and learn more which will be partitioned into chapters. Once a chapter is completed, they will be able to take a quiz to see how far theyâ€™ve come.

## Requirements:
My system aims to reduce the effort and time taken to learn a learn language. All of this can be done using a cellphone or tablet.
Each user must first create an account where they will proceed to use a free trial or a premium subscription where they will be allowed special features such as quizes and performance reviews.
Once a user has logged in, they must choose a language, once the language has been chosen they will then proceed to choose which course they would like to participate in whether it being simple converstaion or learning words on their own, As they continue they will also be allowed to choose the difficulty and pace of their learning process.
Once a user starts the course, after each capter they will be given the choice to complate a quiz, see their results of each quiz and view an overall progress report.
Once a user has completed a course and has enough marks to pass the course they will be awarded a certificate.
The user may choose to learn more than one language at a time.
Once done using the system the user will then log out of the application.

##Use case:
When a user logs in, they will be prompted to enter their log in data which will be followed by a 'sucessfully logged on' event, once verified they will have access to their user profile.
